# Turing Machine & Recursive Function Simulator

## Specific Tasks

### 1. Turing Machine Simulation System
1. **Finite State Machine Simulation**: Simulate the finite state automaton and its state transition process.
2. **Tape and Read/Write Head Simulation**: Simulate the read and write operations on the tape.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: Demonstrate the dynamic execution process of the binary search algorithm in the simulation system with a given input. Provide correct results and count the tape space and steps used.

### 2. Recursive Function Simulation System
1. **Recursive Function Call Simulation**: Simulate the calling process of recursive functions.
2. **Stack and Push/Pop Operations Simulation**: Simulate the stack and its push and pop operations.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: Demonstrate the dynamic execution process of the binary search algorithm in the simulation system with a given input. Provide correct results and count the tape space, stack space, and steps used.

### 3. Performance Comparison of Two Simulation Systems
1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**:
   - **In the Turing Machine Simulation System**: Solve using dynamic programming and branch and bound methods.
   - **In the Recursive Function Simulation System**: Solve using memoization and backtracking methods.
   - **Evaluation Criteria**: Demonstrate the dynamic solving process of the above algorithms in both simulation systems with a given input. Provide the optimal value and solution, and compare the tape and/or stack space and steps used by the algorithms.
